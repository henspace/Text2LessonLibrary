(i) This will be a bit of a longer lesson. We're going to look at how we create our
own lesson quiz.

First, a bit of terminology so we're all on the same page.

When we watch a lesson and answer any questions, we call that _playing_ a lesson.

Lessons are made up of multiple problems, and problems come in five different flavours.

* Multiple choice questions with one correct answer.
* Multiple choice questions with more than one correct answer.
* Fill in the blank questions where you have to fill in the missing words.
* Put the words in the correct order questions.
* Slideshow presentations like this.

In this lesson we will just look at creating a simple multiple choice question
with one correct answer.

The lessons you create are typically stored on your device in the **local library**.


The local library starts with four empty slots. To create a lesson with just one question, 
you would just need to type the following text:

    ? What is the capital of France?
    = Paris
    x London
    x Tokyo
    x Washington

(i) Let's see what that would look like.

The [writing lessons](https://henspace.github.io/text2lesson-docs/writing-lessons.html)
topic provides details on how to edit one of the slots. Open it now, have a look and then have a go at creating a simple question like that one.
