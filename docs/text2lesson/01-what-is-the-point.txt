(i) emoji:🖐️>bigger Welcome

_Text2Lesson_ has been designed to create lessons and quizzes quickly and 
painlessly using simple plain text. 

There are a lot of online quiz generators out there, such as Quizziz and Kahoot,
so what's the point of something else?

Good question.

emoji:🤫>biggest _Text2Lesson_ has been designed so that anyone can use it without creating an
account or providing any personal information. If you're creating
content for your students, you can do so knowing that neither they nor you
will need yet another online account.

The guide you are currently watching has been created using _Text2Lesson_. Let's
use it to ask some questions.

slow, you can increase the reading speed by clicking on those three bars icon:bars at the
top left, and selecting _settings_. You can change all the colours as well.

If you're on a mobile, just swipe them out of the way.

(i) Okay. That was a very, very short lesson — we're just looking at some of the 
things _Text2Lesson_ can do.

This will automatically move on to your certificate for this quiz. You can then
have a go at _My first lesson_.

to be very inspiring.
