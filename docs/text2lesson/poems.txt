 How are you on poetry? We all learnt some at school, but how many lines can you recognise?

_____
(?) Who wrote these words taken from '_The second coming_'?
> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br>
> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br>
> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere <br>
> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br>

= William Butler Yeats
x Tennyson
x Wordsworth
x John Keats

(?) This extract is from the '_The road not taken_', but who wrote it?
> I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
> Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— <br>
> I took the one less traveled by, <br>
> And that has made all the difference. <br>

= Robert Frost
x Rudyard Kipling
x William Shakespeare
x Ogden Nash

(?) Some romance now. These words were written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Do you know the name of the poem?

> I love thee to the depth and breadth and height <br>
> My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight <br>
> For the ends of being and ideal grace. <br>

= How do I love thee?
x Love's philosophy
x Love
x A red, red rose

(?) Let's make you work a bit now. These words are from '_Sonnet 18_' by William Shakespeare. What are the missing words?
> Shall I compare thee to a ...summer's day? <br>
> Thou art more lovely and more temperate: <br>
> Rough winds do shake the ...darling buds of May, <br>
> And ...summer's lease hath all too short a date; <br>
x winter's
x autumn's
x flowering

(?) A famous line from '_If_' but by whom?
> If you can keep your head when all about you <br>
> Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;

= Rudyard Kipling
x Emily Dickinson
x T. S. Eliot
x Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

(?) Who wrote '_The Raven_'?
> Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br>
> Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— <br>
> While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br>
> As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—

= Edgar Allan Poe
x Rudyard Kipling
x Emma Lazarus
x Percy Bysshe Shelley 


(?) These lines are from '_Ozymandias_' by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Can you complete them?

> My name is Ozymandias, ...king of kings: <br>
> Look on my ...works, ye Mighty, and despair!” <br>
> Nothing beside remains. Round the ...decay <br>
> Of that colossal ...wreck, boundless and bare <br>
> The lone and level ...sands stretch far away. <br>
x ruler
x kingdom

(?) '_To a mouse_.' who wrote this classic?
> Wee, sleeket, cowran, tim’rous beastie, <br>
> O, what a panic’s in thy breastie! <br>
> Thou need na start awa sae hasty, <br>
>  Wi’ bickerin brattle! <br>
= Robert Burns
x Walter Scott
x William Shakespeare 
x Robert the Bruce

(?) These lines come from '_Remember_'. This poet also wrote the words to the carol '_In the bleak midwinter_'. Who is this poet?
> Remember me when I am gone away, <br>
> Gone far away into the silent land; <br>
> When you can no more hold me by the hand, <br>
> Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay. <br>
= Christina Rossetti
x Henry John Gauntlett
x William Morris
x William Shakespeare

(?) And for our last question, a bit of nonsense. The words are from '_Jabberwocky_' by Lewis Carroll. Can you complete the nonsense?
> Beware the ...Jabberwock, my son <br>
> The jaws that bite, the claws that ...catch! <br>
> Beware the ...Jubjub bird, and shun <br>
> The frumious ...Bandersnatch! <br>
x Tumtum
x snicker-snack

(i) And that is the end of this nonsense.
