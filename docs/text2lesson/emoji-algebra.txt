(i) We all love emojis emoji:❤️>big, but we don't all love algebra. {math}2x + 3y = 12{math} emoji:🙁>big

Why don't we try to mix things up a bit? Emojis and algebra — what's not to love?

______
? Let's start gently. Look at this equation:

{big}🍌 + 6 = 10{big}

How much is a banana worth?
= 4
x 6
x 10
x 1
& To find out what our banana is worth, we want to get the banana on its own. We could do this:

🍌 + 6 = 10

Take away 6 from both sides. When we do something to one side of the equation we must do exactly the same to the other side.

🍌 + 6 - 6 = 10 - 6

🍌 = 4

Now we have one banana on its own and we can see that one banana equals 4.

In algebra we used symbols for values we don't know. We are using emojis for symbols we don't know.
____________
? How about this one? What's a cherry worth? Remember, when you see a number in 
front of a symbol like this 2🍒 it really means 2&times;🍒.

{big}2🍒 = 20{big}

= 10
x 2
x 20
x 5

& We know that 2 cherries = 20. Let's solve it step by step.

2🍒 = 20

Divide both sides by two. Remember that if you do something to one side you must do the same to the other.

2🍒 ÷ 2 = 20 ÷ 2

🍒 = 10

One cherry equals 10.

You might ask why we divided by 2 and didn't just subtract a cherry from both sides. Let's see what would have happened.

2🍒 = 20

2🍒 - 🍒 = 20 - 🍒

🍒 = 20 - 🍒

It hasn't really helped, has it?
______
(?) Let's step it up a bit. What's the cat worth?

{big}2🐱 + 4🐱 = 12{big}

= 2
x 3
x 6
x 12
& So again, we want to get one cat on its own. Here we go:

2🐱 + 4🐱 = 12

If I have 2 cats and I add 4 more, how many cats do I have?

6🐱 = 12

Now divide both sides by 6.

6🐱 ÷ 6 = 12 ÷ 6

🐱 = 2

Now we know that one cat equals 2.
____

(?) Okay! Now a tricky one. What's the dog worth?

{big}🐱 + 3🐱 = 8{big}

{big}🐱 + 2🐶 = 10{big}

= 4
x 2
x 3
x 8
& This isn't any harder than the others — we just need to take it step by step.

That first equation only has cats, so let's solve that first.

🐱 + 3🐱 = 8

4🐱 = 8

4🐱 ÷ 4 = 8 ÷ 4

🐱 = 2

We now know a cat is worth 2, so wherever we see a cat we can replace it with the number 2. Let's look at the dog and cat equation.

🐱 + 2🐶 = 10

2 + 2🐶 = 10

2 - 2 + 2🐶 = 10 - 2

2🐶 = 8

2🐶 ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2

🐶 = 4

So our dog is equal to 4.

_________
(?) What's the cat worth?

{big}🐶 + 🐱 + 🐹 = 6{big}

{big}🐶 + 🐹 = 4{big}

{big}3🐹 = 9{big}

= 2
x 4
x 6
x 8
& Again just take it step by step. We're always looking to get a symbol on its own. Let's start with the hamster.

3🐹 = 9

Divide both sides by 3.

3🐹 ÷ 3 = 9  ÷ 3 

🐹 = 3 

Now we know what a hamster is equal to, we can look at the dog.

🐶 + 🐹 = 4

Replace the hamster with its value.

🐶 + 3 = 4

Subtract 3 from both sides.

🐶 + 3 - 3 = 4 - 3

🐶 = 1

Now we have the value of the dog, and we already know the hamster. Let's finally tackle the cat.

🐶 + 🐱 + 🐹 = 6

Replace the dog and hamster with their values.

1 + 🐱 + 3 = 6

Rearrange it a bit so it's easier to read:

🐱 + 1 + 3 = 6

Simplify it.

🐱 + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides.

🐱 + 4 - 4 = 6 - 4

🐱 = 2

So our cat is worth 2.

(i) That's enough for now. Just remember when you see an equation like this:

{big}{math} 2x + 3y = 13{math}{big} don't be phased. 

It's just the same as 

{big}2🐶 + 3🐹 = 13{big}
