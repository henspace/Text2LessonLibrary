The Earth travels around the Sun. This was the heliocentric model developed by Nicolaus Copernicus. But when did he propose this?

? Fermat's last theorem states that no three positive integers {maths}a{maths}, {maths}b{maths} and {maths}c{maths} satisfy the equation {maths}a^n + b^n = c^n{maths} for any integer value of {maths}n{maths} greater than 2. He first stated this in around 1637, but it took a few centuries before it was proved to be correct? Who finally managed to prove it?
= Andrew Wiles in 1994
x Albert Einstein in 1909
x Alan Turing in 1942
x Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1918

In 1962, Crick and Watson, together with Maurice Wilkins, won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering the structure of DNA. But controversy surrounds the discovery because of another's scientist's unrecognised contribution to the discovery. Who was she?
= Rosalind Franklin
x Marie Curie
x Lise Meitner
x Mary Somerville

? In 1672 he discovered that white light is made up of distinct coloured rays. Who was this scientist?
